### 1. Hello World

Classic "Hello World" exercise where we introduce sections, registers, and
we perform our first syscalls.

### 2. Sum

Here we introduce labels, jumps, conditionals, and integer math.

### 3. Functions

Here we introduce functions and conventions around function argument
registers and caller vs callee owned.

### 4. Echo

Here we develop a small cli utility which just echoes the string you pass in.
It's meant to illustrate how to access argv and argc plus a first introduction
on loops

### 5. Stack

This exercise shows basic usage of the stack used to reverse a string. It
purposely refrains from using frames.
