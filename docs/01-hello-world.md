Hello world
---

Unsurprisingly, our first program will be a "Hello World".

Before jumping into the code though, we need to briefly introduce the language and the utilities that will turn our code into running software. At the end of this section, we will be able to write, assemble, and run our first assembly program.

## x86-64 assembly

First things first, assembly is not a language.

Assembly refers to a _family of programming languages_ featuring instructions that closely map to the machine code that the CPU will execute. In fact, one of the raisons d'etre of assembly languages is to provide a human-readable version of machine code in situations like reverse engineering, hardware programming, or developing games for consoles.

In this guide, we will use _x86-64 assembly_ which can be assembled and executed on most personal computers. This choice should ease running and tinkering with the snippets along the way. 

For historical reasons, there are two "flavors" of the x64-64 assembly syntax: one called _Intel_ and the other is called _AT&T_.

> [!TIP]
> You can read up on the differences between Intel and AT&T syntax [here](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/kslarsen/dm546/Material/IntelnATT.htm). If it's your absolute first time with assembly, it might be a little too early to make sense of it. Feel free to come back to this link in a couple of lessons.

In this guide we will stick to the _Intel_ dialect because it's used by the [Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html), the source of truth when on what the CPU _really_ does when fed an instruction.

Assembly is all about working close to the hardware. Optimizimg for portability of the code examples across operative systems and architactures would obfuscate the content of this introduction.

The snippets we will be written for Linux, and they should run fine on Window's WSL as well. The general concepts and practices are nonetheless valid regardless of your OS of choice.

## Anatomy of an instruction

Instructions are the way we tell the CPU what to do. They look something like this:

```s
mov rax, rbx
```

They represent the smallest unit of assembly language and are mostly composed of two parts:

* **mnemonic**: a shortened word or sentence that specifies the operation to be performed
* **operands**: a list of 0-3 items representing what's affected by the operation

In our example, the mnemonic is `mov`, which stands for _move_, and the operands are `rax` and `rbx`. This instruction in plain English would read: move the content of `rbx` in `rax`.

> [!NOTE]
> `rax` and `rbx` are registers and we will introduce them in the next paragraph. In the meantime, you can imagine them as variables holding a value.

Some instructions will have more then mnemonic and operands. Additional parts such as _prefixes_ and _size directives_ will only be needed later, and we'll talk through them at the right moment.

Fear not, there is no need to memorize all the possible instructions now. Whenever we'll come across new operations, we will discuss them, and with repetition you will remember in no time.

The [Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html) will be our instruction reference in the next chapters. Keep it handy!

## Storing data: Registers

You can think of registers as storage space baked right into the CPU itself. They are small and incredibly fast to access.

The most common registers are the so-called _general-purpose_ registers. In x86-64 they are sixteen in total and they are 64 bits wide. 

One can access the whole register or just a subset by using different names. For example, using `rax` (as in the code above) would address all the 64 bits in the `rax` register. With `al` you can access the lower byte of the same register.

| Register | Higher byte | Lower byte | Lower 2 bytesÂ¹ |	Lower 4 bytesÂ² |
|:---      |:---         |:---        |:---            |:---             |
| rax      | ah	         | al	        | ax             | eax             |
| rcx      | ch	         | cl	        | cx	           | ecx             |
| rbx      | bh	         | bl	        | bx             | ebx             |
| rdx      | dh	         | dl	        | dx             | edx             |
| rsp      |    	       | spl	      | sp	           | esp             |
| rsi      |             | sil        | si             | esi             |
| rdi      |             | dil        | di             | edi             |
| rbp      |             | bpl        | bp	           | ebp             |
| r8       |             | r8b        | r8w            | r8d             |
| r9       |             | r9b        | r9w	           | r9d             |
| r10      |             | r10b       | r10w           | r10d            |
| r11      |             | r11b       | r11w           | r11d            |
| r12      |             | r12b       | r12w           | r12d            |
| r13      |             | r13b       | r13w           | r13d            |
| r14      |             | r14b       | r14w           | r14d            |
| r15      |             | r15b       | r15w           | r15d            |

General-purpose means that they can store anything, in principle. In practice, we'll see that some registers have special meanings, some instructions only use certain registers, and some conventions dictate who is expected to write where.

The only non general-purpose register we will be concerned with is `rip`, the _instruction pointer_ register. It holds the address of the next instruction to execute and therefore modifying `rip` allows programs to jump to arbitrary instructions in the code.

## Putting it all together: Assembler

We need to convert our instructions into machine code if we want our CPU to execute them. 

Without diving into the details of the process, the only information you need is that it is done in at least two steps: assemble and link.

Assemblers are the tools used for assembling (duh!) our code into object code, a sequence of machine code statements. For this guide we'll use [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) since it's available on all platforms and can be used to produce a variety of different of outputs.

Linkers are used to link (duh!) object code into a single executable. I will be using [ld](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld) the GNU Linker since it's already available on most systems.

## Our first assembly file

Assembly files typically have an `.s` or `.asm` extension and they are split in three sections:
* **data**: where we define constants and initialized variables;
* **bss**: where we define non-initialized variables;
* **text**: where we will type our code, this is the only mandatory section of the file.

```s
section .data
  ; constants here

section .bss
  ; variables here

section .text
  ; code here
```

> [!NOTE]
> The semicolon `;` is the comment character: whatever comes after it will not be executed.

Assembly programs run as you would expect: they start with the first instruction and sequentially execute one intruction after the other, from top to bottom. To create control flow such as conditionals and loops we make our programs 'jump' to specific instructions. We will look at jumps more in detail in the next sections.  

Just as you'd use a `main` function in many high-level languages, assembly requires us to specify an entry point for our program. We do this using the `global` declaration, which points to a _label_.

Labels are assembly's way of giving human-readable names to specific instructions. They serve two purposes: making our code more understandable and allowing us to reference these instructions elsewhere in our program. You can declare a label by writing it followed by a colon, like this: `label:`. When you want to reference a label (for example, in a jump instruction), you use it without the colon: `label`.

Typically, `global` references a `_start` label which is declared immediately after it. That is where our program will start executing.

```s
section .data
  ; constants here

section .bss
  ; variables here

section .text
  global _start
_start:
  ; instructions here
```

## At last, "Hello World"

Finally, we have all the tools to build software in assembly. Very Nice! ðŸ”·

Our program will make use of two system calls, `sys_write`, to print characters in a terminal, and `exit`, to terminate the process with a given status code.

Using syscalls goes like this:
- select the syscall to invoke by moving its identifier in `rax`
- pass arguments to the syscall by populating appropriate registers
- use the `syscall` instruction to fire the call

The only other instruction we will use is `mov`, which we have seen in the instruction paragraph. It works pretty much like an assignment (the `=` operator) in many high level languages: it moves the content of the second operand into the first operand.

Let's look at the code to see how all of this plays together.

> All the code snippets in this guide are heavily commented. Make sure you read the comments carefully!

Assuming the code above is in a file called `01-hello-world.asm`, we can now finally assemble and launch our first program

```sh
# assemble the code and store the resulting object files in the `build` folder
nasm -g -f elf64 -o 01-hello-world.o 01-hello-world.asm

# link the objects into the executable 01-hello-world.out 
ld -o 01-hello-world.out 01-hello-world.o

# execute the code
./01-hello-world.out
```

## Conclusion

We have an hello world. You're happy!

In this first article we learned some basic assembly concepts, we cut our teeth on its syntax, and we even wrote some working software. 

We now know how to communicate with the operative system and we are ready to produce more interesting programs in the next article.
